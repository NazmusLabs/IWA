            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Super DX-Ball</strong> is a <em>shareware</em> game by
              BlitWise Productions, released on November 10, 2004. It is an
              enhanced remake to the classic brick-buster hit DX-Ball. Among new
              features since previous games, Super DX-Ball introduces refined,
              classic-style graphics (as a tribute to the original game) and a
              dimension of bricks with various shapes and sizes (originally
              inspired from Rival Ball Tournament), adding a unique gameplay
              experience in a Breakout-style game.

            <p>
              As a common concept of <strong><em>Breakout clone</em></strong
              >:was, the objective of the game is to clear all the bricks on the
              screen in order to advance to the next board. The player controls
              a paddle at the bottom of the screen by using the mouse or
              keyboard, keeping one or more balls by deflecting them into a
              field of bricks on the screen without missing the only ball in
              play. Some bricks may appear to be solid, take multiple hits to
              clear, invisible, or explosive. As bricks are being cleared, a
              random power-up will occasionally be released onto the screen. The
              player may choose to catch these with the paddle, or avoid them
              depending on the effect whether it is positive, neutral or
              negative. Negative power-ups usually increases the difficulty,
              while neutral may vary depending on the situation. The power-ups
              of Super DX-Ball are direct clones from previous games, with
              several minor alterations (e.g. when the player gets a "Fast
              Ball", the ball now will only speed up slightly instead of
              accelerating to full speed, and the "Extra Life" were no longer
              remove the paddle enhancements).
            </p>
            <p>
              Similar to previous installments, if only one brick remain on the
              board and taking too long to hit it, the brick will be destroyed
              by a lightning bolt.
            </p>
            <p>
              A unique element of the game is when the ball gets stuck between
              the unbreakable bricks for too long, the ball transforms into a
              "gold ball" and can clear any bricks in one hit, unlike in
              previous games where unbreakable bricks are transformed into
              regular ones when the ball is stuck for a certain amount of time.

          <h2 id="history">History & Development</h2>
          <p>
            Programmed by Michael P. Welch in 2004, Super DX-Ball was considered
            to be indirect sequel and as a tribute to the original game, rather
            than a follow-up to Rival Ball. Unlike its predecessors, the
            graphics were designed to retain the classic style, recycling the
            graphics for the bricks and power-ups, a pure black background, but
            with an updated texture for the paddle (vaguely resembling the
            "Vaus" from Arkanoid). However, these graphics are greatly refined
            with a high-colour 32-bit 2D engine, giving a more smoother look and
            solid colours.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key aspect of Super DX-Ball is the introduction of geometric
            bricks with various shapes and sizes that creates an artistic board
            design and eye-catching patterns, adding a unique gameplay
            experience of a Breakout clone. Most of these new board designs are
            usually based on abstract art and mosaics, though several others
            form simple pictures and clip-arts. While the freeware version only
            offer 27 of these boards, the full pack of 90 other boards are only
            available in the registered version.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from the newly designed geometric boards, the game also offer
            the classic gameplay experience with regular rectangular bricks, by
            introducing several classic-style boards that paid tribute to the
            original game, including the original boards from DX-Ball. There are
            a total of 145 classic boards, with only 70 of them are made
            available in the freeware version.

          <h2 id="dlc">Board Packs</h2>
          <p>
            The freeware version comes with six different board packs:
            <em>Classic</em>, <em>Super</em>, <em>Challenge</em> (demo),
            <em>Surprise</em> (demo), <em>Fun</em> (demo), and
            <em>Retro</em> (demo), and features a total of 97 boards. The game
            also features a tribute to MegaBall 3 for the Amiga, including a
            hidden MegaBall board pack, which contains the 20 boards from the
            original game. This easter egg can be discovered by clicking on the
            <em>Mega Ball</em> power-up icon on the title screen. Notably, the
            Classic board pack (which contains all 50 boards from the original
            DX-Ball) also used to be an easter egg, prior to version 1.1, in
            which it could be obtained by clicking the grey
            <strong><em>Amiga Boing Ball</em></strong> icon on the title screen,
            between the words "DX" and "BALL".
          </p>
          <p>
            The registered version of the game, referred to as Super DX-Ball
            Deluxe, features a total of 245 boards, expanding the demo board
            packs to their entirety of 30 boards each for Challenge, Surprise,
            and Fun, and 75 boards for Retro. It also adds support for
            additional board expansion packs, of which there are two available,
            as of June, 2012:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bonus Pack: 15 new levels (Free)</li>
            <li>Treasure Pack: 10 new levels (Free)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Trivially, there is a secret message encoded (via binary code) into
            the final level of Treasure Pack, which reads "DX-BALL 1996 TO 2006
            AND STILL THE BEST.
